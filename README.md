# Rina's HTML Link page

#### This was mainly a personal project of mine which I thought I share with the world. This is simply a HTML template which you can use to link people to your own social media pages or websites. To do this you would need to self host your own website.

To customize just open up the HTML page in your favorite text editor and customize your links. You can customize the background and colour in the style.css located in the CSS folder. 

That's all to it really. If you don't know how to edit HTML or CSS, well google is your friend.

Example website is my own here:
